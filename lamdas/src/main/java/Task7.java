//        Task 7. (15 points) Math collector for the IntStream
//•	Write a custom collector for the IntStream or integer generator like
//        Stream.iterate(0,i->i+10).limit(1_000_000)
//•	This collector should calculate the sum, count, average, min, max over the stream items.
//•	Define your own object to keep math stats.
//•	Add tests for your collector.
//•	Tune performance with Characteristics and collect the results into the small performance report that should be attached to your final solution. Discuss with mentor the given results.
//•	It should support parallel streams.
